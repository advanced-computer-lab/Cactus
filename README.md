<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To start contributing in this repo you will first have to clone the repo and npm install a few things.

## Motivation

We have decided to create this project for numerous reasons .To start with, implementing
what we have learned in terms of languages and Technologies on a real life Application ,that gave us the opportunity to discover different Flight Companies' Websites 
and add our input as well as create something of our own.The Competition in the Market was for sure very competitive thus creating something Unique was a must to ensure our survival and Market Presence.
The Reason we have come up with this idea is that we felt that most of the available websites in the market doesn't 
satisfy All the needs of the Customers interms of (Prices,Flight Availability,comfortability ..etc )and there is a gap that we decided to Fill. Thats where we decided to step in !!.

## Build Status
Till now there aren't any reported issues from any Customers. However, We appreciate your opinion and any improvements you suggest on cactusairlines@gmail.com

## Code Style 
Our Coding Style was one of the Key Factors that made this project possible. We have used a Convention that we all agreed on to make the project scalable in the future 
* Egyptian Style Curly Braces
* Small Line Length
* Indentation when inside a block to be able to differentiate the Code(Nesting Levels)
* CamelCase in Naming Functions and Variables
* Exception Handling Convention(Error Return Values)
